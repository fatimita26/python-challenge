Using python to read files

In this challenge I was able to read and work with that data contained in two Csv files.

The first one referenced a bank with only two columns (Date and Profit/loss) and the second with three columns referencing an election in a small town. I was able to implement and use functions to analyze and identify major KPI that provide a better use and understanding of the data.
